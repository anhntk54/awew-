Attr.DefaultInvalidImage
TYPE: string
DEFAULT: ''
--DESCRIPTION--
This is the default image an img tag will be pointed to if it does not have
a valid src attribute.  In future versions, we may allow the image tag to
be removed completely, but due to design issues, this is not possible right
now.
